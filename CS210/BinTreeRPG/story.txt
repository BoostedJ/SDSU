1 | You sit down at your computer. The constant hum of flying cars pass your high-rise apartment, a sound that has become more commonplace than silence itself.\n\nYou notice a notification from your email, but also an intriguing headline on the news. | 2 | 3 | 1. Visit my email | 2. Click on the news article
2 | You open your inbox. Among the usual clutter is a message with a subject line: "New Lead." It's from Kai, your partner in crime and childhood friend. The message is brief, but you notice a link. | 4 | 3 | 1. Visit the link | 2. Check the news headline first
3 | The headline reads: "NeuroTech Pushes for Much-Needed Brain Chip Mandates."\nWhen skimming the article, you notice a statement from NeuroTech's CEO, describing the chip as a step forward; "a safer society through predictive intelligence."\nYour stomach twists--you know what this "predictive intelligence" really means | 2 | -1 | 1. Go back and check my email | 2. null
4 | The link leads to a seemingly inconspicuous site, probably made by Kai himself, but you notice that a download has started in the background.\n\nIt's a document.\n\nYou also notice a new connection to the secure messaging system you and Kai had developed. | 5 | 6 | 1. Open the document | 2. Go to the messaging app
5 | Almost immediately, you notice the top of the document. "Project Mind Breach" with a subheader "Top Secret Confidentiality."\n\nHow the hell did Kai even get this?\nYou start skimming the document.\n\nThe first few lines are shocking.\nNeuroTech's brain chips won't just "enhance intelligence"--this you already knew--they're designed to track, control, and even erase memories.\n\nYour mind begins racing. Do you feel anxious, knowing you need to do something to stop it? Should you be relieved that it's finally confirmed?\nEither way, you need to start communicating in real-time. | 6 | -1 | 1. Open the messaging app | 2. null
6 | [176.112.39.140]: Did you read that shit I sent you yet? | 9 | 7 | 1. Yeah, I'm reading it now. This is absolutely insane. Mind control? This goes deeper than we thought | 2. I mean, I got it. I didn't read it though
7 | [176.112.39.140]: You should really go look, it's serious | 5 | 8 | 1. Alright, give me a second... | 2. Can you just tell me what it is?
8 | [176.112.39.140]: I really think it's better if you see for yourself | 5 | -1 | 1. Alright, give me a second... | 2. null
9 | [176.112.39.140]: I know, I'm just glad you were at your computer. What should we even do? I have a couple of ideas... we could try to leak this shit everywhere! Or we could try breaking in and destroying them from inside. What do you think? | 10 | 25 | 1. Leaking would be the safest idea | 2. We should try dealing some irreversible damage
10 | [176.112.39.140]: I agree... I just fear it'll be too loud and we'll get the feds on our case again. You're right though, we should try that. | 11 | 20 | 1. Let's try independent media outlets | 2. We should go with something we know; underground forums
11 | You decide to target some smaller media sources to get the word out quickly but quietly. You draft a series of emails with the document attached.\n\nThe plan: send it anonymously with a message detailing the truth about NeuroTech and their Project Mind Breach. | 19 | 12 | 1. Send the emails and await replies | 2. Have Kai handle the distribution and monitor NeuroTech's activity
12 | [176.112.39.140]: Yea, I think I can handle that. Just make sure you let me know as soon as anything goes abnormal, I'm trusting you here. | 13 | -1 | 1. Yeah, no worries, I got your back | 2. null
13 | You monitor NeuroTech's activity using a specially designed software you and Kai developed, as Kai starts sending out emails.\n\nWithin the first couple of minutes, it doesn't seem like anything is happening; these news reporters are definitely seeing it. It's their job to see everything within seconds.\nThe lack of a response is almost enough to put you on edge. | 14 | -1 | 1. Continue monitoring NeuroTech | 2. null
14 | You notice that the motion detection system you set up in the apartment corridor starts going off. Panic starts to set in. It goes off more times than it could realistically go off if it was just a neighbor.\n\nRegardless, you know who it is. You feel your heart drop. | 15 | 16 | 1. Quickly warn Kai | 2. Try to erase all traces of the leak on my end
15 | [176.112.39.140]: Wait, they're at your place?? Are you sure? Fuck dude, we're fucked! How did they even know!? They must've been watching for a while now! | 16 | 17 | 1. Just try wiping everything on your end, I'm gonna start up on mine | 2. Yea, I think this is it for us, I just can't believe it happened so fast
16 | You insert a flash drive specially designed to completely wipe a desired amount of time off of your computer like it never happened. You are prompted to enter the time in minutes. | 17 | 17 | 1. Wipe the last 30 minutes | 2. Screw it, just enter 9999
17 | Almost immediately, your door flies open as suited agents come pouring in armed with weapons you've never seen before. You know resistance simply won't do anything, and your only exit is blocked. How did it even get to this point? Did NeuroTech have their eyes on you this whole time? | 18 | -1 | 1. Give up
18 | You reluctantly put your hands up.\nIt's over.\nThe agents surround you, weapons trained, the reality of the situation hits you like a gut punch-you and Kai thought you could expose the truth about as powerful of a corporation as NeuroTech, and remain untouchable.\nThis was never a fair fight. You were outmatched; watched from the start. The very systems you thought would protect you were the ones that gave you away.\nYou can't help but feel the brief, fleeting thrill you've had since the start--the thrill of fighting for something real.\nBut like Icarus, you flew too close to the sun. The unforgiving flames caught up with you.\n\nAnd now, NeuroTech remains one step closer to their full control. | -2 | -2 | 1. null | .2 null
19 | You start sending out emails using a secure connection through an anonymous source. \n\nWithin the first couple of minutes, it doesn't seem like anything is happening; these news reporters are definitely seeing it. It's their job to see everything within seconds.\nThe lack of a response is almost enough to put you on edge. | 14 | -1 | 1. Continue waiting | 2. null
20 | You start posting all over underground forums that you're a part of. Almost immediately, due to your reputation on some of these sites, you watch them as they start picking up traffic.\nAlthough, seemingly even sooner than that, bots start to spam the posts.\nWho the hell is botting our forums? People should be dying to get this information, not trying to cover it up and have it taken down by the moderation system!\nOf course, you quickly realize these forums are breached and this must be NeuroTech's doing. | 21 | 23 | 1. Try countering the bots | 2. Start spreading bots of my own to post blitz across every forum I know
21 | You frantically begin trying to counter the bots, using every trick you know to keep the posts visible. It must be NeuroTech, whoever this is is fast and efficient--new posts get buried almost immediately, and threads begin getting locked by an unknown force.\nEvery second feels like it slips further out of your control. The walls feel like they're closing in, and a single, abrupt thought comes across your mind: am I sure I'm truly anonymous? | 22 | -1 | 1. Message Kai for a backup plan | 2. null
22 | [176.112.39.140]: I think our only hope is to bot back! That's what I've been doing, try using the ones we used to mess around with and hook them to every forum you know! | 23 | -1 | 1. Alright, I'm starting them up right now then. | 2. null
23 | Despite your best efforts, NeuroTech's countermeasures are relentless. Every forum, every site, every page that even seems to make mention of Project Mind Breach triggers automatic shutdowns.\n\nYou quickly realize there's not much left to do and it's time to start cutting losses. | 24 | 23 | 1. Tell Kai that it only seems to be making matters worse | 2. Keep going
24 | [176.112.39.140]: I see that... I think we should probably wipe everything and maybe try later. I really don't have a good feeling about this. | 14 | 14 | 1. I agree. I don't feel great either | 2. Alright, I'll get on it
25 | [176.112.39.140]: Haha, I like the way you think. We still have our backdoor set up, it doesn't seem like they have any idea.\n[176.112.39.140]: There's no room for mistakes, I can get you root access to one of their main servers, but I'm sure it will only be open for a short time. Are you ready? | 28 | 26 | 1. Yep, I'm ready. Let's get to it. | 2. Wait, shouldn't we have an exit plan first?
26 | [176.112.39.140]: Oh come on, it'll be fine as long as you're quick. | 28 | 27 | 1. You're right, let's just get this done. | 2. No, we need a backup plan or I'm not doing this.
27 | [176.112.39.140]: Alright, fine. If anything goes wrong, just remember you have that flash drive with the program we made to wipe all data created on your computer after a time you set. Just plug it in and go. Good enough? | 28 | -1 | 1. I guess so, I'm not sure what else we can do | 2. null
28 | [176.112.39.140]: Awesome, I sent you 2 files, one called NUKE.exe I got off of some black market guy, it's supposed to delete every single file and wipe their entire database.\n[176.112.39.140]: The other one is the CorruptNet.dll, this one should corrupt their internal communication system, it might not be necessary. | 29 | -1 | 1. Sounds good, what about any backups they might have? | 2. null
29 | [176.112.39.140]: Good question, I thought about that. NUKE should automatically get rid of those too. I'm not sure how it works exactly, but if anything touches what NUKE is overriding gets corrupted, deleted, and destroyed. | 30 | -1 | 1. Sounds perfect. I'll be waiting for you to open the root for me then | 2. null
30 | [Server] You now have ROOT access to server [NEUTECH00] | 31 | -1 | 1. scp NUKE.exe NEUTECH00 | 2. null
31 | [Server] Successful server copy NUKE.exe from [PSERV] to [NEUTECH00] | 32 | 38 | 1. connect NEUTECH00 | 2. scp CorruptNet.dll NEUTECH00
32 | [Server] Connected to server [NEUTECH00] | 33 | -1 | 1. run NUKE.exe | 2. null
33 | NUKE.exe starts wiping files, and you watch as directory after directory gets erased. A security alert flashes on the screen: "Emergency Lockdown in Progress." They're trying to shut down the servers and remotely contain the damage. | 34 | 14 | 1. Attempt to bypass the lockdown | 2. Abort and disconnect
34 | You continuously try to override the lockdown, occasionally temporarily stalling it; directories continue to disappear and NUKE.exe is wiping everything in sight. However, the system is now alerting every security team NeuroTech has. | 35 | 14 | 1. Try to finish the wipe quickly, then disconnect | 2. Abort and disconnect
35 | You ignore the warnings and let NUKE.exe continue until the final file disappears until only NUKE.exe itself remains.\n\nYou sigh in relief.\n\nThe files don't seem to be coming back, it seems it did the job of wiping any backups that may have been stored in other servers.\n\nAs you reach to enter in the disconnect command, you notice your motion sensors in the hallway going off. Almost immediately, you know exactly who it must be. | 36 | 36 | 1. Disconnect and wait. | 2. Disconnect and wait.
36 | The door swings open as suited agents come pouring in armed with weapons you've never seen before. You know resistance simply won't do anything, and your only exit is blocked. Caught in the act, you're left with the cold satisfaction that NeuroTech's data is lost--yet the freedom you sought to protect is as well. | 37 | 37 | 1. It's over... | 2. How did this happen?
37 | It's a pyrrhic victory.\n\nWhile you've been captured by NeuroTech forces, your actions resulted in a greater awareness of what NeuroTech is doing. You can almost guarantee you will not be the last resistance force, though, you hope you won't be the most successful.\n\nNeuroTech will undoubtedly try to regrow, you can only hope others will do what it takes to stop them.\n\nYour story ends as a hero; a martyr for the greater good. | -2 | -2 | 1. null | 2. null
38 | [Server] Successful server copy CorruptNet.dll from [PSERV] to [NEUTECH00] | 39 | -1 | 1. connect NEUTECH00 | 2. null
39 | [Server] Connected to server [NEUTECH00] | 33 | 40 | 1. run NUKE.exe | 2. inject CorruptNet.dll
40 | With the CorruptNet.dll injected, you only have a short time before NeuroTech notices something is up, and it's time to act fast. | 41 | -1 | 1. run NUKE.exe | 2. null
41 | NUKE.exe begins running. You watch as directory after directory gets erased. You can't help but grin, knowing that someone working at NeuroTech is surely freaking out, unsure what to do, with no one to contact. | 42 | 43 | 1. Stay connected and monitor the process | 2. Disconnect and make your escape
42 | You watch as the backup servers try to restore what is lost. New directories replacing the old appear, only to be deleted and give the NUKE.exe a new connection to tie itself into. The hydra is falling, but it won't allow itself to go gracefully. The victory feels unreal. | 43 | -1 | 1. Disconnect and make your escape | 2. null
43 | With the NUKE.exe continuing to run, you  successfully disconnect and delete all ties to the server before the NUKE.exe has time to reach you. \n\nYou take a big sigh of relief. What's done is done.\n\nYou look out of your apartment window to see the city lights, as a news report on the billboard displays "Project Mind Breach."\n\nHow did they find out?\n\nYou soon find out Kai, while NeuroTech was busy trying to get a grip on the NUKE.exe, had been spamming forums and sending out leaks to the media. The world now knows, and others will take up the fight.\nToday, David has felled Goliath. | -3 | -3 | 1. null | 2. null
