Based on Table 3.8, simulate the event of a Prussian soldier dying due to a horse kick. Construct a histogram from 10,000 simulations. Subsequently, contrast this with a histogram generated from the Poisson distribution using the R command: rpois(10000,0.61).

```{r cars}
deaths=c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
probs=c(0.543,0.331,0.101,0.021,0.003,0.000)
simlist=replicate(10000,sample(deaths, 1, prob=(probs)))
hist(simlist, breaks=deaths, xlab="Number of deaths", main="Histogram of Deaths by Horse Kick")
hist(rpois(10000,0.61), breaks=deaths, xlab="Number of deaths", main="Poisson Histogram of Deaths by Horse Kick")
```
