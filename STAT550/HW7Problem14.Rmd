# Homework 7
## A bag contains one red, two blue, three green, and four yellow balls. A sample of three balls is taken without replacement. Let upper B be the number of blue balls and Y the number of yellow balls in the sample.
## Simulate the mean and variance of the total number of blue and yellow balls in the sample.

```{r num14}
bag=c("R","B","B","G","G","G","G",replicate(4,"Y"))
simulation=function() {
  pull=sample(bag, 3, replace=FALSE)
  B=sum(pull=="B")
  Y=sum(pull=="Y")
  return(c(B,Y))
}
n=10000
sims=replicate(n, simulation())
meanB=mean(sims[1, ])
meanY=mean(sims[2, ])
varB=var(sims[1, ])
varY=var(sims[2, ])
print(sprintf("Mean of blues: %.2f, mean of yellows: %.2f", meanB, meanY))
print(sprintf("Variance of blues: %.2f, variance of yellows: %.2f", varB, varY))
```
